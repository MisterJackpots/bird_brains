# Relational Rails Project - Bird Brains

This project was assigned to me during the first week of Mod2 at the Turing School of Software and Design.

### The learning goals of this project were to:

* Design a one-to-many relationship using a schema designer.

* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.

* Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources.

* Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers.

* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior.

Below is the schema I created for this project, which reflect the relationship between the two databases:

This project was completed through Iteration 2.
